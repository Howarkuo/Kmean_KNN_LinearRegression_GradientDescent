Linear Regression Matrix 

1. Create a row matrix (A)
2. Turn it into column matrix (A.transpose)
3. Create 'Desing matrix'- (np.concatenate)
Concatenate the column matrix with 1 column matrix (e.g: if the old matrix is 1*n , the concatenate matrix is 2*n)
The reason why to concatenate with 1 vector is to fit it into line equation y =m.x +c .1 , if we multiple this new 2*n matrix with matrix.T (matrix = [slope, intercept ]) we can solve the line equation y
Without the column of 1's, the math forces the line to go through the origin (0,0), preventing the line from shifting up or down to fit the data
4. Obtain the line formula. 
dervied from A.x = b -> x = A^-1 .b
EXTEND  to 15 points:
by multiply both side by A^T ,   A is (15 x2), A^T is (2x 15) , A^T x A becomes a (2x2) square matrix
so Ax = b -> A^T .A .x= A^T.b, 
now solve for x , x= ( A^T . A) ^-1  x (A^T x b)
5. create start point coordinate for the regression line (x0) and derive y0
